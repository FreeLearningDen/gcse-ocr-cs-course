# 📘 1.1 – Systems Architecture (OCR GCSE Computer Science)

In this section, I will be covering **Systems Architecture**, as outlined in the OCR J277 GCSE Computer Science specification. This includes understanding how the CPU functions, what affects its performance, and the role of embedded systems.

## 🧠 1.1.1 Architecture of the CPU

### 🧭 Purpose of the CPU
- Understand the **Fetch-Execute Cycle**:
  - How instructions are fetched from memory, decoded, and executed.

### ⚙️ Common CPU Components and Their Functions
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** – Handles arithmetic and logical operations.
- **CU (Control Unit)** – Directs operations within the CPU.
- **Cache** – Stores frequently accessed data for quick retrieval.
- **Registers** – Small, fast storage locations within the CPU.

### 🧮 Von Neumann Architecture
- **MAR (Memory Address Register)** – Stores memory addresses.
- **MDR (Memory Data Register)** – Holds data fetched from or to be written to memory.
- **Program Counter (PC)** – Tracks the address of the next instruction.
- **Accumulator** – Temporarily holds data being processed.

## 🚀 1.1.2 CPU Performance

### 🔍 Key Characteristics Affecting Performance
- **Clock Speed** – Faster clocks = more instructions per second.
- **Cache Size** – Larger cache can reduce memory access times.
- **Number of Cores** – More cores allow parallel processing.

## 📟 1.1.3 Embedded Systems

### 🔧 Purpose and Characteristics
- Designed to perform **specific tasks**.
- Often part of a larger system.

### 💡 Examples
- Washing machines  
- Microwave ovens  
- Smart thermostats  
- Engine control units
