## 📚 Topic Summary

The **Fetch-Execute Cycle** involves the following stages:

1. **Fetch**  
   The Program Counter (PC) holds the address of the next instruction. This address is sent to the Memory Address Register (MAR), and the instruction is fetched into the Memory Data Register (MDR). The PC is then incremented.

2. **Decode**  
   The Control Unit (CU) decodes the instruction in the MDR and determines the necessary operation.

3. **Execute**  
   If it's a calculation, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) carries it out. Results may be stored in the Accumulator or written back to memory.
